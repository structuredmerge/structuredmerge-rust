Compatible with Rust unknown.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>StructuredMerge package family and backend compatibility</summary>

StructuredMerge packages provide fixture-backed merge behavior for document, configuration, source, archive, and binary formats. Shared contracts live in fixtures, while Go, Ruby, Rust, and TypeScript packages expose language-native APIs over the same behavior.

| Package | Layer | Families | Status | README role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ast-template | workflow | template, readme | active | applies shared templates, package README sections, and package-directory sync workflows |
| ast-merge | core | template, review, structured-edit | active | documents provider-neutral contracts, token resolution, review state, and execution reports |
| tree-haver | backend substrate | parser, backend | active | documents backend selection, language-pack integration, position data, and capability reporting |
| markdown-merge | family | markdown | active | documents Markdown heading, fenced-code, nested-family, and provider behavior |
| json-merge | family | json, jsonc | active | documents JSON and JSONC merge behavior; old jsonc-merge is superseded |
| toml-merge | family | toml | active | documents TOML table, value, parser, and backend behavior |
| yaml-merge | family | yaml | active | documents YAML mapping, sequence, scalar, and backend behavior |
| ruby-merge | family | ruby-source | active | documents Ruby source merge behavior; old prism-merge is backend/provider prior art |
| zip-merge | family | zip, archive | active | documents ZIP member planning and raw-preservation behavior |
| binary-merge | family | binary | active | documents binary preservation and diagnostics behavior |

| Backend | Languages | Families | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| tree-sitter-language-pack | Go, Ruby, Rust, TypeScript | markdown, toml, yaml, source | Preferred cross-language parser substrate where a family has language-pack support. |
| native ecosystem parser | Ruby | ruby, yaml, markdown, toml | Backend-specific Ruby packages are provider prior art or adapters, not the source schema. |
| plain structured text | Go, Ruby, Rust, TypeScript | plain, binary, zip | Families without parser requirements document preservation, byte ranges, archive members, and diagnostics. |

| Compatibility claim | Current disposition | Fixture source |
|---|---|---|
| Old Ruby runtime backend tables | Prior art only; not a cross-language support promise | slice-741 backend/platform reconciliation |
| tree-sitter-language-pack | Current portable parser substrate for Go, Ruby, Rust, and TypeScript | slices 122, 135, 171, 195, 215 |
| Native parser/adaptor backends | Implementation-specific providers documented through family fixtures | slices 122 and 183 |
| bash-merge, dotenv-merge, rbs-merge | Excluded from generated support tables until explicit scope decisions exist | slice-741 unresolved package list |
